编译可能出现的错误以及解决办法

1. Cannot find Eigen:
	There is a new package called cmake_modules which contains some commonly used dependencies which do not have CMake modules by default. Currently the list includes:

    FindEigen.cmake
    FindNUMPY.cmake
    FindTBB.cmake
    FindTinyXML.cmake

    FindXenomai.cmake 

If you would like to use one of these in your CMakeLists.txt of your package, simply follow the usage instructions here: 
	https://github.com/ros/cmake_modules/blob/0.3-devel/README.md. Briefly as follows:
	step 1: in package.xml, add <build_depend>cmake_modules</build_depend>
	step 2: in CMakeLists.txt: add find_package(cmake_modules REQUIRED) and find_package(Eigen REQUIRED)

2. Cannot find ncurses.h
问题的解决：

在Ubuntu下，“apt-get install libncurses5-dev”安装上ncurses库即可。
